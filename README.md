# PaoLarm-SP25-CMPS-375
PaoLarm is an AI-powered alarm system designed to ensure you wake up and stay awake by combining voice recognition, motion detection, and interactive challenges. The alarm progressively gets harder to stop if inactivity is detected, making it nearly impossible to go back to sleep.
